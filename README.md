# LSR-Kicks-Website
This repository is the official website for the Instagram account 'lsr.kicks'

The website was made using html, css, and bootstrap. 

The homepage is the file 'index.html'. As of right now, the website is still no where near finished. The next steps for the developement of the website is to connect it to a backend, add javascript to add event listeners, use an api for the sign ups/ logins and connect it to a database for an email list, and change the frontent framework of the website to react.
